Figure: SCL Comparison Across Tasks (Resting State and DMT)
Group-level mean ± SEM for Skin Conductance Level (tonic component (baseline-corrected)) across 11 subjects during two tasks. Left panel: Resting State (RS) with eyes closed, comparing High (green) versus Low (purple) dose conditions. Right panel: DMT task, comparing High (red) versus Low (blue) dose conditions. The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–9:00) with tick marks every minute. The Y-axis displays Δ SCL (μS) with a fixed range of [−5, 5] μS to enable direct comparison across tasks. Shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). Each curve is the average of 11 individual subjects' SCL time series, resampled to a common 2 Hz grid and then averaged point-wise. The plot highlights dose-dependent modulation in both resting and active psychedelic states.


Figure: DMT Task SCL Extended Time Course (0–19 minutes)
Group-level mean ± SEM for Skin Conductance Level (tonic component (baseline-corrected)) during the DMT task across the extended recording period (19 minutes 10 seconds). The plot compares High (red) versus Low (blue) dose conditions. The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–19:00) with tick marks every minute. The Y-axis displays Δ SCL (μS) with a fixed range of [−5, 5] μS. Shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). This extended time series (N = 11 subjects) reveals the temporal dynamics of the tonic electrodermal component throughout the full DMT experience, including onset, peak, and offset phases. The longer recording window allows examination of sustained dose effects beyond the acute psychedelic state.


Supplementary Figure: Individual Subject SCL Time Series (Stacked Layout)
Per-subject Skin Conductance Level (tonic component (baseline-corrected)) time series for all 11 validated subjects. Each row represents one subject, with the subject code displayed in bold on the left margin. Left column: Resting State (RS) with eyes closed, showing High (green) and Low (purple) dose sessions overlaid. Right column: DMT task, showing High (red) and Low (blue) dose sessions overlaid. The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–9:00) with tick marks every minute. The Y-axis displays Δ SCL (μS) with a fixed range of [−5, 5] μS across all subjects to facilitate visual comparison. Both axes are shared across all subplots to enable direct between-subject comparisons of signal amplitude and temporal dynamics. This layout reveals individual variability in SCL responses to dose and task conditions, complementing the group-level averages shown in the main figures. Notable inter-individual differences can be observed in baseline levels, response magnitudes, and temporal patterns.
