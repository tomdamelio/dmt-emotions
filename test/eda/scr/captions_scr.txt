Figure: SCR Comparison Across Tasks (Resting State and DMT)
Group-level mean ± SEM for Skin Conductance Response (phasic component) across 11 subjects during two tasks. Left panel: Resting State (RS) with eyes closed, comparing High (green) versus Low (purple) dose conditions. Right panel: DMT task, comparing High (red) versus Low (blue) dose conditions. The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–9:00) with tick marks every minute. The Y-axis displays SCR (μS) with a fixed range of [−5, 5] μS to enable direct comparison across tasks. Shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean (SEM). Each curve is the average of 11 individual subjects' SCR time series, resampled to a common 2 Hz grid and then averaged point-wise. The plot highlights dose-dependent modulation in both resting and active psychedelic states.


Supplementary Figure: Individual Subject SCR Time Series (Stacked Layout)
Per-subject Skin Conductance Response (phasic component) time series for all 11 validated subjects. Each row represents one subject, with the subject code displayed in bold on the left margin. Left column: Resting State (RS) with eyes closed, showing High (green) and Low (purple) dose sessions overlaid. Right column: DMT task, showing High (red) and Low (blue) dose sessions overlaid. The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–9:00) with tick marks every minute. The Y-axis displays SCR (μS) with a fixed range of [−5, 5] μS across all subjects to facilitate visual comparison. Both axes are shared across all subplots to enable direct between-subject comparisons of signal amplitude and temporal dynamics. This layout reveals individual variability in SCR responses to dose and task conditions, complementing the group-level averages shown in the main figures. Notable inter-individual differences can be observed in baseline levels, response magnitudes, and temporal patterns.
