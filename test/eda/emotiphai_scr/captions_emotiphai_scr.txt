Figure: SCR Frequency Time Course (EmotiPhai Detection)

Group-level mean ± SEM for skin conductance response (SCR) frequency during two tasks.
SCRs were detected using the EmotiPhai algorithm. The plot shows the number of SCRs per minute over 9 minutes.

Left panel: Resting State (RS) with eyes closed, comparing High (green) versus Low (purple) dose conditions (N=11 subjects).
Right panel: DMT task, comparing High (red) versus Low (blue) dose conditions (N=11 subjects).

The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–9:00) with tick marks every minute. Data points are plotted at the center of each 1-minute bin.
The Y-axis displays SCR count per minute (frequency of discrete SCR events).
Shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) across subjects.

This analysis quantifies the temporal dynamics of autonomic arousal by counting discrete phasic electrodermal responses, 
providing a complementary measure to the continuous SCR amplitude time series. Higher SCR frequency indicates 
increased sympathetic nervous system activity and arousal.
