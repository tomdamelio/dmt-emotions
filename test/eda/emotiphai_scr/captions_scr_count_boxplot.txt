Figure: SCR Count Distribution (Boxplot with Individual Points)

Boxplot showing the distribution of skin conductance response (SCR) counts across tasks and doses.
SCRs were detected using the EmotiPhai algorithm and counted over 9 minutes.

The plot shows four conditions:
- Resting State (RS) High Dose (green, N=11)
- Resting State (RS) Low Dose (purple, N=11)  
- DMT High Dose (red, N=11)
- DMT Low Dose (blue, N=11)

Boxplots show median (line), quartiles (box), and range (whiskers). Individual points represent 
each subject's SCR count with horizontal jitter for visibility. Gray lines connect the same 
subject's high and low dose measurements within each task condition, showing individual 
within-subject dose effects. The Y-axis displays the total number of SCRs detected during 
the 9-minute recording period.

This analysis reveals the distribution and variability of autonomic arousal levels by counting 
discrete phasic electrodermal responses. Higher SCR counts indicate increased sympathetic nervous 
system activity and emotional arousal.
