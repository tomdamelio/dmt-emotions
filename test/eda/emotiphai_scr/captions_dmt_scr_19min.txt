Figure: DMT SCR Frequency Time Course (19 Minutes)

Group-level mean ± SEM for skin conductance response (SCR) frequency during DMT task.
SCRs were detected using the EmotiPhai algorithm. The plot shows the number of SCRs per minute over 19 minutes.

The plot compares High (red) versus Low (blue) dose conditions for the DMT task (N=11 subjects).
The X-axis represents time in minutes (0:00–19:00) with tick marks every minute. Data points are plotted at the center of each 1-minute bin.
The Y-axis displays SCR count per minute (frequency of discrete SCR events).
Shaded regions represent the standard error of the mean (SEM) across subjects.

This extended time course analysis reveals the temporal dynamics of autonomic arousal throughout the full DMT session, 
providing insight into how SCR frequency evolves over the complete 19-minute recording period. Higher SCR frequency 
indicates increased sympathetic nervous system activity and emotional arousal during the DMT experience.
