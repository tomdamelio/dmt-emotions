TET Testing and Development Scripts

This directory contains testing, inspection, verification, and development

- Quick testing during development
- Inspecting intermediate results
- Verifying data integrity
- Comparing different approaches
- Demonstrating specific features

For the production TET analysis pipeline, use:
    python scripts/run_tet_analysis.py
