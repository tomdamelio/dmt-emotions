## Phase-Based Temporal Analysis

To address potential temporal misalignment in pointwise comparisons, we examined dose-dependent effects within two temporal phases: onset (0–3 min) and recovery (3–9 min). Results revealed distinct temporal dynamics across autonomic systems (Table S1).

**Table S1.** Phase-based comparisons of physiological responses between High (40 mg) and Low (20 mg) DMT doses.

| Modality | Phase | High Mean (SD) | Low Mean (SD) | *t* | df | *p* | Cohen's *d* |
|----------|-------|----------------|---------------|-----|----|----|-------------|
| **ECG (HR)** | Onset (0–3 min) | 1.89 (0.72) | 1.42 (0.68) | 2.09 | 10 | .063 | 0.63 |
| | Recovery (3–9 min) | 1.76 (0.58) | 1.12 (0.49) | 4.43 | 10 | **.001** | 1.34 |
| **EDA (SMNA)** | Onset (0–3 min) | 5.21 (4.12) | 4.58 (3.89) | 0.66 | 10 | .527 | 0.20 |
| | Recovery (3–9 min) | 4.87 (3.45) | 3.12 (2.98) | 2.73 | 10 | **.021** | 0.82 |
| **RESP (RVT)** | Onset (0–3 min) | 0.89 (0.54) | 0.48 (0.42) | 2.48 | 11 | **.030** | 0.72 |
| | Recovery (3–9 min) | 0.62 (0.48) | 0.41 (0.38) | 1.62 | 11 | .134 | 0.47 |

*Note.* Values represent z-scored physiological responses. Significant effects (*p* < .05) are shown in bold. HR = heart rate; SMNA = sympathetic nervous system activity; RVT = respiratory volume per time.

For heart rate and electrodermal activity, significant dose-dependent differences emerged during the recovery phase (3–9 min post-inhalation), with High dose producing greater responses than Low dose (HR: *t*(10) = 4.43, *p* = .001, *d* = 1.34; SMNA: *t*(10) = 2.73, *p* = .021, *d* = 0.82). In contrast, respiratory responses showed significant dose differences during the onset phase (0–3 min; *t*(11) = 2.48, *p* = .030, *d* = 0.72), suggesting a more rapid respiratory adaptation to DMT. These findings indicate that cardiovascular and electrodermal systems exhibit sustained dose-dependent activation during recovery, whereas respiratory effects are more prominent during initial drug onset.

## Temporal Feature Extraction

We extracted temporal features from individual time series to characterize response magnitude and timing (Table S2).

**Table S2.** Extracted temporal features comparing High versus Low DMT doses.

| Modality | Feature | High Mean (SD) | Low Mean (SD) | *t* | df | *p* | Cohen's *d* |
|----------|---------|----------------|---------------|-----|----|----|-------------|
| **ECG (HR)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 2.88 (0.71) | 2.08 (0.62) | 2.33 | 10 | **.042** | 0.70 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 2.25 (0.89) | 1.57 (0.72) | 1.81 | 10 | .101 | 0.55 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 0.93 (0.48) | 0.89 (0.52) | 0.13 | 10 | .896 | 0.04 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 1.25 (0.68) | 1.02 (0.58) | 0.66 | 10 | .526 | 0.20 |
| **EDA (SMNA)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 8.55 (5.12) | 7.46 (4.89) | 0.39 | 10 | .702 | 0.12 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 1.89 (1.24) | 1.61 (1.08) | 0.32 | 10 | .753 | 0.10 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 0.61 (0.42) | 0.71 (0.48) | −0.41 | 10 | .690 | −0.12 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 0.84 (0.52) | 0.71 (0.45) | 0.58 | 10 | .574 | 0.18 |
| **RESP (RVT)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 1.43 (0.82) | 0.65 (0.58) | 1.89 | 11 | .085 | 0.55 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 3.88 (2.12) | 3.71 (1.98) | 0.12 | 11 | .904 | 0.04 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 1.50 (1.24) | 2.31 (1.68) | −0.94 | 11 | .377 | −0.33 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 2.19 (1.42) | 2.56 (1.58) | −0.42 | 11 | .688 | −0.15 |

*Note.* Peak amplitude reflects maximum response magnitude (z-scored). Time-to-peak and threshold crossing times are in minutes from DMT inhalation. Significant effects (*p* < .05) are shown in bold.

Heart rate peak amplitude was significantly greater for High compared to Low dose (*t*(10) = 2.33, *p* = .042, *d* = 0.70), indicating a dose-dependent increase in maximum cardiovascular response. Respiratory peak amplitude showed a trend toward dose-dependent effects (*t*(11) = 1.89, *p* = .085, *d* = 0.55). Electrodermal activity did not show significant dose differences in extracted features, suggesting that EDA dose effects are more distributed across time rather than concentrated at peak responses.

## Baseline Comparisons: DMT versus Resting State

To quantify the overall magnitude of DMT-induced autonomic changes, we compared extracted features between DMT conditions (doses collapsed) and Resting State baseline (Table S3).

**Table S3.** Comparison of temporal features between DMT (collapsed across doses) and Resting State baseline.

| Modality | Feature | DMT Mean (SD) | RS Mean (SD) | *t* | df | *p* | Cohen's *d* |
|----------|---------|---------------|--------------|-----|----|----|-------------|
| **ECG (HR)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 2.48 (0.69) | −0.04 (0.25) | 14.24 | 10 | **< .001** | 4.29 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 1.91 (0.77) | 5.02 (1.45) | −6.80 | 10 | **< .001** | −2.05 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 0.89 (0.52) | 4.14 (3.07) | −3.68 | 8 | **.006** | −1.23 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 1.14 (0.73) | 4.58 (2.53) | −5.14 | 8 | **< .001** | −1.71 |
| **EDA (SMNA)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 8.00 (3.89) | 1.05 (0.92) | 5.96 | 10 | **< .001** | 1.80 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 1.75 (1.12) | 2.61 (1.38) | −2.13 | 10 | .059 | −0.64 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 0.68 (0.45) | 1.54 (1.24) | −1.72 | 10 | .137 | −0.65 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 0.82 (0.48) | 1.86 (1.18) | −2.12 | 10 | .079 | −0.80 |
| **RESP (RVT)** | Peak amplitude (z) | 1.04 (0.68) | 0.35 (0.42) | 4.27 | 11 | **.001** | 1.23 |
| | Time-to-peak (min) | 3.79 (1.98) | 4.81 (2.24) | −1.39 | 11 | .192 | −0.40 |
| | Time to 33% max (min) | 2.27 (1.42) | 1.52 (1.18) | 1.20 | 11 | .257 | 0.35 |
| | Time to 50% max (min) | 2.79 (1.52) | 2.06 (1.38) | 1.03 | 11 | .327 | 0.30 |

*Note.* DMT values represent means collapsed across High and Low doses. RS = Resting State. Significant effects (*p* < .05) are shown in bold. Effect sizes: small (*d* = 0.2), medium (*d* = 0.5), large (*d* = 0.8).

All three physiological modalities showed significantly greater peak amplitudes during DMT compared to Resting State, with very large effect sizes (HR: *d* = 4.29; SMNA: *d* = 1.80; RVT: *d* = 1.23; all *p* ≤ .001). These findings confirm that DMT induces robust autonomic activation across cardiovascular, electrodermal, and respiratory systems.

Heart rate showed dramatically faster time-to-peak during DMT (1.91 min) compared to Resting State (5.02 min; *t*(10) = −6.80, *p* < .001, *d* = −2.05), indicating rapid cardiovascular onset following DMT inhalation. Threshold crossing times were also significantly faster for HR during DMT (time to 33% max: *p* = .006; time to 50% max: *p* < .001). Electrodermal activity showed trends toward faster onset during DMT (time-to-peak: *p* = .059; time to 50% max: *p* = .079), while respiratory timing did not differ significantly between conditions.

## Summary of Supplementary Findings

The supplementary analyses provide convergent evidence for dose-dependent autonomic effects of DMT:

1. **Phase-based analysis** revealed that cardiovascular (HR) and electrodermal (SMNA) dose effects are most pronounced during the recovery phase (3–9 min), while respiratory (RVT) effects emerge during onset (0–3 min).

2. **Feature extraction** identified significant dose-dependent increases in heart rate peak amplitude (*p* = .042, *d* = 0.70), with trends for respiratory peak amplitude (*p* = .085).

3. **Baseline comparisons** confirmed that DMT induces robust autonomic activation across all modalities (all *p* ≤ .001 for peak amplitude), with particularly rapid cardiovascular onset (*d* = −2.05 for time-to-peak).

These findings complement the main time-to-time FDR analyses by characterizing the temporal dynamics and magnitude of dose-dependent autonomic responses to DMT.
