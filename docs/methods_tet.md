# Methods: Temporal Experience Tracking (TET) Analysis

Subjective dynamics were assessed using Temporal Experience Tracing (TET), a retrospective, time-resolved quantitative phenomenological method in which participants draw continuous curves for predefined experiential dimensions within each state (resting state [RS] and DMT). Before the first session, participants received standardised instruction and practice on a mobile application (Human Experience Dynamics, Ltd.), and practice traces were reviewed to ensure procedural understanding. The fifteen dimensions (Pleasantness, Unpleasantness, Emotional Intensity, Elementary Imagery, Complex Imagery, Auditory, Interoception, Bliss, Anxiety, Entity, Selfhood, Disembodiment/Embodiment, Salience, Temporality, and General Intensity) were translated into Spanish and selected a priori based on literature specifically defining experiential constructs relevant to DMT [4–8]. The retrospective, time-resolved tracing approach follows prior uses of TET in other domains (e.g., meditation, breathwork, clinical and social contexts), supporting its suitability for modelling within-session phenomenological dynamics [9–12].  Expanded definitions of all fifteen dimensions are provided in the Supplementary Methods of [13].
The two-minute auditory chimes described in the Procedure were rendered as temporal anchors in the TET interface to guide retrospective placement of experiential features. TET time series were sampled at 0.25 Hz (one sample every 4 seconds), yielding 150 samples for the 10-minute RS baseline and 300 samples for the 20-minute DMT period. To reduce inter-individual differences in scale use, all TET values were transformed into within-subject z-scores using each participant’s mean and standard deviation across all dimensions and all four sessions. Raw scale values were retained for descriptive summaries.
Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the full set of within-subject standardised TET values pooled across participants and sessions. Component loadings were used to interpret the experiential constructs captured by PC1 and PC2. To identify discrete experiential states, K-means clustering was applied at the time-bin level. Model selection relied on silhouette scores, and stability was assessed using bootstrap resampling with adjusted Rand indices. For the selected k, cluster probabilities for each time bin were compared between High and Low dose within DMT using paired t-tests with FDR correction.
Finally, two core affective dimensions were derived from the standardised TET ratings to capture valence and arousal. As an arousal proxy, we used the Emotional Intensity dimension, which reflects the momentary strength of emotional experience irrespective of hedonic tone. As a valence proxy, we constructed a composite Valence Index computed as Pleasantness minus Unpleasantness at each time point, such that higher scores reflect more positively valenced experience. These measures were entered into subsequent analyses alongside the remaining individual dimensions. For each participant and dose condition, each time series was averaged within non-overlapping 30-second windows over the first 9 minutes after t₀, yielding 18 time bins per session. 

Statistical analyses
All behavioural and physiological measures were analysed within a linear mixed-effects (LME) framework in Python (statsmodels MixedLM [17]). For each outcome we used the 18 non-overlapping 30 s windows from 0–9 min as repeated observations nested within participants. The time index was mean-centred (window₍c₎ = window− mean(window)), and minutes were treated as repeated observations nested within participants.
For each modality, we fit an LME with fixed effects for State (resting state [RS] vs DMT), Dose (Low = 20 mg, High = 40 mg), Time (window₍c₎), and the two-way interactions (State × Dose, State × Time, Dose × Time), plus a random intercept per participant to account for within-subject dependence. This specification tests the primary State × Dose interaction, main effects, and whether temporal trajectories differ by state or dose. Models were fit by maximum likelihood, and fixed-effect estimates are reported as β with 95% confidence intervals. To control multiplicity, Benjamini–Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) adjustments were applied within each outcome family, and adjusted p values are reported as p₍FDR₎. When informative, conditional contrasts (for example, High − Low within DMT) were derived algebraically from the fixed-effects estimates. For visualization, group trajectories are plotted as mean ± SEM. In extended descriptive checks, paired pointwise t-tests across participants were computed at each 30 s window within RS and within DMT, and BH-FDR was applied across windows to highlight intervals with significant High vs Low differences (α = .05).
The dependent variables were: Valence Index (z) and Arousal index (z; i.e. Emotional Intensity) derived from the TET ratings. In all cases, t₀ was defined per state as recording onset for RS and end of exhalation for DMT.
