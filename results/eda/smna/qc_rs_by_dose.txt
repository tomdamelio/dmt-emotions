QC CHECK: RS AUC by Dose
============================================================

Scale: z-scored

      count    mean     std
Dose                       
Low     198 -0.8198  1.3344
High    198 -1.0783  0.8958

Note: Z-scoring uses ALL sessions of subject (RS_high + DMT_high + RS_low + DMT_low).
Both sessions share the same normalization parameters (mu and sigma).
RS High and RS Low should have similar means (both near 0) since they use
the same subject-level baseline.
