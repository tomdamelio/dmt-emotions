Figure: LME Coefficients (SMNA AUC)

Point estimates (β) and 95% CIs for fixed effects from the mixed model. Reference line at zero aids interpretation. Significant effects are visually emphasized.



Figure: Marginal Means Over Time (RS vs DMT × High vs Low)

Group-level mean ± 95% CI of SMNA AUC across the first 9 minutes for each condition (RS Low/High, DMT Low/High). Legends indicate dose levels; shading shows uncertainty.



Figure: Main State Effect Over Time

Mean ± 95% CI for RS and DMT (averaged across dose) across minutes 0–8. Illustrates overall state separation and temporal trend.



Figure: State × Dose Interaction (Panels)

Left: RS Low vs High; Right: DMT Low vs High. Lines show mean ± 95% CI across minutes 0–8. Highlights how dose effects differ between states.
