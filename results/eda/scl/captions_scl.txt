Figure: LME Coefficients (SCL Window Mean - Z-scored)

Point estimates (β) and 95% CIs for fixed effects from the mixed model. Dependent variable: per-30-second-window mean of z-scored SCL. Z-scoring computed using entire session (RS + DMT) as baseline per session. Mu and sigma computed from concatenated RS + DMT data. Reference line at zero aids interpretation. Significant effects are visually emphasized.



Figure: Group-level SCL Timecourse (9 min) - Z-scored

Two panels (RS, DMT) showing mean ± SEM over time in z-scored units; High vs Low dose with legends. Z-scoring based on entire session (RS + DMT) per session. Gray shading indicates FDR-significant differences (High vs Low) across time. Time axis in minutes (0–9).



Figure: DMT-only SCL Timecourse (~19 min) - Z-scored

Extended DMT timecourse showing mean ± SEM in z-scored units; High vs Low dose. Z-scoring based on entire session (RS + DMT) per session. Gray shading indicates FDR-significant differences (High vs Low) across time. Time axis in minutes (0–19).



Figure: Per-subject SCL Timecourse (9 min) - Z-scored

Individual subject traces for RS (left) and DMT (right) in z-scored units. Z-scoring based on entire session (RS + DMT) per session. High/Low dose traces shown in respective colors. Subject codes centered between panels.
