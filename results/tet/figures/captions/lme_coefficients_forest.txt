Figure: Linear Mixed Effects Model Coefficients

Forest plots showing standardized regression coefficients (β) with 95% confidence 
intervals for fixed effects in linear mixed effects models. Separate panels show 
State effects (DMT vs RS), Dose effects (High vs Low), and State×Dose interaction 
effects. Filled circles indicate statistically significant effects (p_fdr < .05), 
open circles indicate non-significant effects. Vertical line at β=0 represents null 
effect. Dimensions are ordered by magnitude of State main effect.

Statistical Analysis: Linear mixed effects models with formula:
  Dimension ~ State*Dose + Time_c + State:Time_c + Dose:Time_c + (1|Subject)
Multiple comparison correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across 15 dimensions.
