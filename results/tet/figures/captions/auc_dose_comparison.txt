Figure: Area Under Curve Comparison Between Dose Conditions

Boxplots comparing area under the curve (AUC, 0-9 minutes) between Low dose (20mg, blue) 
and High dose (40mg, red) conditions within DMT sessions. AUC represents cumulative 
intensity over time (z-score × minutes). Grey lines connect paired observations from 
the same subject. Significance stars indicate FDR-corrected p-values from Wilcoxon 
signed-rank tests: * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001. Effect sizes (r) with 95% 
bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed for significant comparisons.

Statistical Analysis: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (paired, two-tailed).
Effect size: Rank-biserial correlation (r) with 2000 bootstrap iterations.
Multiple comparison correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across 15 dimensions.
