Figure: Temporal Dynamics of Subjective Experience Dimensions

Time series plots showing mean trajectories (±SEM) for all 15 TET dimensions across 
DMT sessions. Blue lines represent Low dose (20mg), red lines represent High dose (40mg).
Grey dashed vertical line indicates DMT onset (end of resting state baseline). Grey 
background shading indicates time bins where DMT significantly differs from resting 
state baseline (p < .05, FDR-corrected). Black horizontal bars indicate time bins 
with significant State×Dose interaction effects (p < .05, FDR-corrected). Dimensions 
are ordered by strength of main State effect from linear mixed effects models.

Statistical Analysis: Linear mixed effects models with random subject intercepts.
Multiple comparison correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR.
Time window: 0-20 minutes for DMT, 0-10 minutes for resting state.
