Figure: Time to Peak Comparison Between Dose Conditions

Boxplots comparing time to peak intensity (in minutes) between Low dose (20mg, blue) 
and High dose (40mg, red) conditions within DMT sessions. Grey lines connect paired 
observations from the same subject. Significance stars indicate FDR-corrected p-values 
from Wilcoxon signed-rank tests: * p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001. Effect sizes 
(r) with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals are displayed for significant comparisons.

Statistical Analysis: Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (paired, two-tailed).
Effect size: Rank-biserial correlation (r) with 2000 bootstrap iterations.
Multiple comparison correction: Benjamini-Hochberg FDR across 15 dimensions.
