Figure: Dose Effects on Peak, Time-to-Peak, and AUC Metrics

This set of three figures shows dose-dependent effects (High 40mg vs Low 20mg) on 
temporal dynamics of subjective experience dimensions during DMT sessions.

Panel A (peak_dose_comparison.png): Peak intensity values (z-scores) reached during 
the first 9 minutes of DMT sessions. Higher peak values indicate stronger subjective 
experiences on that dimension.

Panel B (time_to_peak_dose_comparison.png): Time in minutes when peak intensity was 
reached. Earlier peaks indicate faster onset of subjective effects.

Panel C (auc_dose_comparison.png): Area under the curve (AUC) from 0-9 minutes, 
representing the cumulative intensity of experience over time. Higher AUC indicates 
sustained elevated experiences.

Visual elements:
- Blue boxes: Low dose (20mg)
- Red boxes: High dose (40mg)
- Gray lines: Paired observations connecting the same subject across doses
- Stars above dimensions: Significant dose effects after FDR correction
  * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001

Dimensions are ordered by effect size (absolute value of Wilcoxon r statistic) from 
left to right, with strongest dose effects shown first.

Statistical test: Wilcoxon signed-rank test (paired, non-parametric) with 
Benjamini-Hochberg FDR correction across 15 dimensions.
