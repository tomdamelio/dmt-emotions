QC CHECK: RS RSP_RVT by Dose
============================================================

Scale: z-scored

      count    mean     std
Dose                       
Low     216 -0.2269  0.5138
High    216 -0.0713  0.4283

Note: Z-scoring uses ALL sessions of subject (RS_high + DMT_high + RS_low + DMT_low).
Both sessions share the same normalization parameters (mu and sigma).
RS High and RS Low should have similar means (both near 0) since they use
the same subject-level baseline.
