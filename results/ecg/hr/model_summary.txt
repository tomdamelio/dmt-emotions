LME MODEL SUMMARY
============================================================

Fixed Effects Formula:
HR ~ State*Dose + window_c + State:window_c + Dose:window_c

Random Effects: ~ 1 | subject

Model Fit Statistics:
AIC: -inf
BIC: -inf
Log-likelihood: inf
N observations: 792
N subjects: 11

Significant Fixed Effects (p_FDR < 0.05):
• State (DMT vs RS): β = 0.691 ***
• Dose (High vs Low): β = -0.268 ***
• State × Time: β = -0.086 ***
• State × Dose: β = 1.132 ***
