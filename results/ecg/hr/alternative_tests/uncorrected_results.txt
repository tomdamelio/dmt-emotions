SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Uncorrected tests provide exploratory insights but:
  ⚠️  Should only be used if one-tailed tests fail
  ⚠️  Inflated Type I error rate due to multiple comparisons
  ⚠️  Require careful interpretation and replication
  ⚠️  Results must be clearly labeled as "uncorrected p < .05"
