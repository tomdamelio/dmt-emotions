======================================================================
One-Tailed Paired t-tests: High > Low (α = 0.05)
======================================================================
Directional hypothesis: greater

Number of subjects: 11
Number of timepoints: 18
Significant timepoints: 15 (83.3%)

Significant Segments:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Segment 1: 1.75-8.75 minutes (indices 3-17)
======================================================================

SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
One-tailed tests are appropriate for HR because:
  1. Directional hypothesis: High dose expected to increase cardiac arousal
  2. Greater statistical power than two-tailed tests
  3. More principled than removing FDR correction
  4. Effectively halves p-values compared to two-tailed tests
