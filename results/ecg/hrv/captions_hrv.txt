Figure: LME Coefficients (HRV RMSSD)

Point estimates (β) and 95% CIs for fixed effects from the mixed model. Reference line at zero aids interpretation. Significant effects are visually emphasized.



Figure: Marginal Means Over Time (RS vs DMT × High vs Low)

Group-level mean ± 95% CI of RMSSD (ms) across the first 9 minutes for each condition (RS Low/High, DMT Low/High). Legends indicate dose levels; shading shows uncertainty.



Figure: Main Task Effect Over Time

Mean ± 95% CI for RS and DMT (averaged across dose) across minutes 0–8. Illustrates overall task separation and temporal trend.



Figure: Task × Dose Interaction (Panels)

Left: RS Low vs High; Right: DMT Low vs High. Lines show mean ± 95% CI across minutes 0–8. Highlights how dose effects differ between tasks.



Figure: Discrete HRV RMSSD Timecourse (9 min)

Two panels (RS, DMT) showing mean ± 95% CI at each minute (discrete points with markers). Gray shading indicates FDR-significant minutes (High vs Low). Time axis: minutes 1–9.



Figure: Stacked Per-Subject HRV RMSSD (9 min)

Individual subject RMSSD traces for RS (left) and DMT (right) conditions. High/Low dose traces shown with discrete markers. Subject codes centered between panels.
